<td>It provides rules about how equations must be put together and how they can be changed. Mathematicians have found that the easiest way to write down the general rules of algebra is to use what are called variables. Variables are symbols (usual letters like a, b, x, y). They represent, or take the place of, either any number or an unknown number. For example, one of the rules of algebra says that a + b = b + a. In this case, a and b are variables that represent any numbers. The rule is true no matter what numbers the letters represent. If a = 3 and b = 2 or if a = 246 and b = 912 the rule is still true. That is, 3 + 2 = 2 + 3 and 246 + 912 = 912 + 246, and so on. Algebra and variables make it easier to solve math problems. To solve a math problem, simply write the problem as an equation. Use a letter, or variable, for the number that needs to be figured out. You can then read the equation as a question with the words “what number” in the place of the variable. The rules of algebra can then be used. The rules allow you to change the equation until it tells what number is represented by the variable. Algebra can be useful for solving problems in real life. With algebra and basic arithmetic—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—it is possible to solve almost any equation that has a variable.</td>
